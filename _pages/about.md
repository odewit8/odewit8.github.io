About me
======
I am currently a final year PhD student at the University of Cambridge. In Cambridge, I am affiliated with the Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics ([DAMTP](https://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/)). In Oxford, I am a Recognised Visiting Student at the [Mathematical Institute](https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/), where my PhD supervisor is, [Maria Bruna](https://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/bruna/).

Research
======
I am interested in mathematically understanding the emergence of collective behaviour in groups of animals. Examples of this emergence are lane formation in groups of ants or pedestrians, or flocking in birds.

I specialize in studying these phenomena using
* Stochastic interacting particle systems,
* Mean-field limit partial differential equations (PDEs).

More specifically, I focus on
* PDE analysis (well-posedness, (non)linear stability, bifurcations),
* Numerical PDE and SDE schemes,
* Numerical analysis,
* Rigorous mean-field limits,
* Parameter inference from data.

In my work I have studied a model for lane forming ants, together with my co-authors (see [Publications](https://odewit8.github.io/publications/) for a link to the paper). The model that I studied there is a so-called *active matter* model.

A main challenge in studying this model, and other models for active matter, is that it does not have a gradient flow structure,
<p>$$ \partial_t f\neq\nabla\cdot(f\nabla U). $$</p>
