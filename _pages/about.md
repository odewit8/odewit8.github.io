About me
======
I am currently a final year PhD student at the University of Cambridge and the University of Oxford. I am a PhD student at the University of Cambridge Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics [(DAMTP)](https://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/). I am a Recognised Visiting student at the University of Oxford [Mathematical Institute](https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/). My supervisor is [Maria Bruna](https://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/bruna/).

Research
======
I am interested in mathematically understanding the emergence of order in groups of animals. Examples of this emergence are lane formation in groups of ants or pedestrians or flocking in birds.
